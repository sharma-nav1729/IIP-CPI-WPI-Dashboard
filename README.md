# ðŸ“Š IIP-CPI-WPI Dashboard

This project aims to develop **interactive, real-time dashboards** for tracking and visualizing key Indian economic indices:

- **Index of Industrial Production (IIP)**
- **Consumer Price Index (CPI)**
- **Wholesale Price Index (WPI)**

It is designed to showcase my skills in **data analysis**, **Python programming**, and **dashboard development**, and serves as a proof of work for my portfolio.

## ðŸš€ Project Objectives

- Collect and update economic index data in real-time or scheduled intervals.
- Visualize trends, seasonal patterns, and sector-wise comparisons.
- Provide interactive features like filters, date range selectors, and sector toggles.
- Host dashboards online for public access and sharing.
